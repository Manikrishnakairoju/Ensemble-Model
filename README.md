# Ensemble-Model
Rather than depending on one model, ensemble models use the diversity of multiple base models to provide more accurate and resilient predictions. Merging results from multiple models means that ensemble methods are powerful techniques that are used throughout various sectors to deliver reliable and robust forecasts.


Part A: Predict Heart Disease
Note: Use the heartdisease.csv dataset for this part.
Import the required Python libraries.
Perform exploratory data analysis.
Perform required feature engineering, feature selection and Train-Test split.
Apply the Max voting simple ensemble technique using the following algorithms to predict whether a patient has heart disease:
Decision tree classifier
Logistic regression
KNN


Part B: Predict Item Sales
Note: Use the bigmart.csv dataset for this part.
Import the required Python libraries.
Perform exploratory data analysis.
Perform required feature engineering, feature selection and Train-Test split.
Apply the following boosting algorithms to predict item sales:
Adaptive boosting (AdaBoost)
Gradient boosting (GBM)
Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)
